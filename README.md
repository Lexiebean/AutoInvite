Version 0.5

Introducing AutoInvite, for those who want a quick way to invite friends to their group or raid!

Essentially, whenever someone whispers you and that whisper contains a customizable keyword (it can be mixed in among other things), you'll automatically issue a group or raid invite to them [if you're allowed to].
AutoInvite loads defaulted to on, party invites, using the keyword "invite me".

Usage: /autoinvite or /ai <options>
	/ai alist : invites people from the A priority list
	/ai blist : invite people from the B priority list
	/ai status : Displays the current options setting.
	/ai on|off : Turns AutoInvite's automatic invite issuing on or off.
	/ai party|raid: changes the group checking: "Party" mode is made for five-man groups only, "Raid" mode handles 40-man raid groups.  There's not a lot of difference, else.
